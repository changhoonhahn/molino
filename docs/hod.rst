Halo Occupation Distribution
============================

We use the Halo Occupation Distribution (HOD) framework to construct the Molino galaxy mocks. HODs statistically populate galaxies in dark matter halos by specifying the probability of a given halo hosting N galaxies based on its halo mass. We use the standard Zheng *et al.* (2007) HOD model. 

For the fiducial HOD parameters, we use the following values

*   ``log Mmin = 13.65``
*   ``sigma_logM = 0.2``
*   ``log M0 = 14.0``
*   ``alpha = 1.1``
*   ``log M1 = 14.0``

These values are based on the best-fit HOD parameters for the SDSS high luminosity samples (Mr < -21.5 and <-22), modified to accommodate the halo mass limit of the Quijote simulations.
